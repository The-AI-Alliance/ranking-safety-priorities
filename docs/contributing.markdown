# How to Contribute to this Project

We welcome your contributions to our project for domain-ranked safety risks. The sources for this documentation are in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/ranking-safety-priorities){:target="rsp-repo"}. 

# Join Our Work Group

We are structuring this work group to support people with any level of time and expertise they can contribute. If you want to join our regular meetings, join one of our domain-expert panels, or otherwise contribute, use the form on [this page](https://thealliance.ai/working-groups/trust-safety#trust-and-safety-form){:target="join-us"} to let us know your interests. (Mention this project in the _message_ field.)


# Making Smaller Contributions

You may not have the time or the expertise to be extensively involved, but you can easily make suggestions for small improvements. Please either [post issues](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/ranking-safety-priorities/issues){:target="rsp-repo"} or contribute changes as [pull requests](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/ranking-safety-priorities/pulls){:target="rsp-repo"}. Notice that every page has _Edit this page on GitHub_ links, making it easy to view a page, then go straight to the source to make edits and submit a PR! This is the best way to help us fix typos and make similar small improvements.

The [README](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/ranking-safety-priorities){:target="rsp-repo"} for the source repo explains more details for testing the website locally and for creating more extensive changes as PRs, such as adding new content. The README also describes our "DCO" requirements, which you should understand first.

If you do't have a GitHub account, which is required for posting issues or PRs, then [send us email](mailto:contact@thealliance.ai) with your suggestions.
