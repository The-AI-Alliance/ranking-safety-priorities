Welcome to the **The AI Alliance** Project for **Ranking AI Safety Priorities by Domain**.

A challenge for software development teams adopting generative AI is making sense of the safety issues that their applications must address. The AI safety ecosystem is broad and growing quickly, making it difficult for these development teams to know where they should focus their efforts. What safety concerns are most important for them to work on first?

The goal of this project is to explore the highest priority safety concerns for specific key domains, starting with finance, healthcare, education, and legal, then expanding to additional domains later.

We are gathering domain experts in these areas to clarify use cases, how they want to use AI for accomplishing their goals. From the use cases, we are identifying the most important safety concerns.

We will publish our findings in a "living" guide, one that will evolve over time. We will also collaborate with other Alliance work groups to ensure that tool options are available for users to act on these findings.

## Domains

This documentation is organized into research for the following [domains]({{site.baseurl}}/domains/domains):

* [Finance]({{site.baseurl}}/domains/Finance)
* [Healthcare]({{site.baseurl}}/domains/Healthcare)
* [Education]({{site.baseurl}}/domains/Education)
* [Legal]({{site.baseurl}}/domains/Legal)

We are also adding content for other domains as we encounter them:

* [Telecom]({{site.baseurl}}/domains/Telecom)

The [domains]({{site.baseurl}}/domains/domains) landing page has some additional information about where to find domain-specific datasets and benchmarks.
